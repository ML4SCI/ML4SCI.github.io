description: Shape optimization is an essential task in many engineering and physics domains when the geometry of an object strongly influences its performance and efficiency. The Shape optimization via Physics-Influenced Neural Networks (SPINN) project aims to automate and streamline the task of shape optimization via the use of Physics Influenced Neural Networks and Coordinate Projection Networks.
