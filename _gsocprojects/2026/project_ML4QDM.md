## Baseline ML Strategy
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand detector feature distributions and data quality issues.
- Begin with classical baseline models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
- Address class imbalance using techniques like reweighting or resampling if needed.
- Evaluate performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.
- Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness across different data-taking periods.
