## 📝 How to Apply

> **⚠️ The 2026 GSoC student application period has not yet begun.** Check back February 19th, 2026 for updates.

### Application Process (General)

```
1. Browse Project Ideas → 2. Contact Mentors → 3. Complete Evaluation Test
       ↓                                                    ↓
4. Write Your Proposal  ←←←←←←←←← Feedback ←←←←←←←←←←←←
       ↓
5. Submit via GSoC Portal by deadline
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Explore the ideas page** — visit [ml4sci.org/gsoc/2026/summary.html](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2026/summary.html) and read through available projects
2. **Reach out to mentors** — introduce yourself early and ask questions about the project scope
3. **Complete the evaluation test** — each project has a specific coding/analysis test to demonstrate readiness
4. **Write a strong proposal** — your proposal should include:
   - Project understanding and motivation
   - Technical approach and methodology
   - Timeline with milestones
   - Relevant background and experience
5. **Submit on time** — proposals must be submitted through the [official GSoC portal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

### Tips for a Strong Application

- ✅ Start early — reach out to mentors at least 4–6 weeks before the deadline
- ✅ Be specific — clearly describe your technical approach, not just goals
- ✅ Show your work — include relevant code samples, GitHub links, or prior projects
- ✅ Demonstrate domain knowledge — show you understand the science behind the project
- ✅ Ask good questions — thoughtful questions demonstrate engagement with the problem
- ❌ Don't send generic proposals to multiple mentors simultaneously without customization
