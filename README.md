## About ML4SCI

ML4SCI [(Machine Learning for Science)](https://ml4sci.org) is an open-source organization that promotes the use of machine learning techniques in scientific research. We collaborate amazing people together to develop machine learning methods for cutting-edge problems . 

At ML4SCI, we strive to create an inclusive and supportive community that encourages participation and engagement from individuals from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. Our community events and forums provide a platform for sharing ideas, discussing challenges and opportunities, and exploring new frontiers in the intersection of machine learning and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)

## ML4SCI in GSoC 
The ML4Sci open source organization is participating in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
