## Introduction

In 2024 ML4SCI is participating in the program as a GSoC umbrella organization.
The ML4SCI organization has partnered with the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) in 2024 to broaden student participation in machine learning projects over a wide variety of scientific fields.
ML4SCI participants will be mentored by scientists at top research universities and laboratories on research projects at the cutting edge of science.
Projects span a wide range of scientific domains, including physics, astronomy, planetary science, quantum information science and others.



### For Students


In 2024 GSoC students work with their mentors for 175 hrs to produce open-source codes that apply machine learning solutions to solve science problems. Projects span three evaluation periods that allow for students and mentors to collaborate on their project and evaluate student progress. Detailed rules for the GSOC program can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/).
Interested students should look at the ideas page and contact the mentors. Candidates will be asked to complete an evaluation test for each project they apply to demonstrate the skills needed for the respective projects.
In the next step, students will produce a proposal which will be evaluated for final student selection.  

**Proposals need to be submitted via GSoC portal by April 2**


Please see the [official GSoC Timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/)
