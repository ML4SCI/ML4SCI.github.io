## Description

This project focuses on developing a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for analyzing real strong gravitational lensing datasets to study dark matter distribution. Strong gravitational lensing, a key prediction of general relativity, occurs when a massive galaxy or cluster bends light from a background source, creating arcs or Einstein rings. Traditional algorithms struggle or fail entirely when applied to real lensing datasets due to observational complexities and noise. By leveraging PINNs, the project will integrate physical laws directly into the learning process, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of dark matter inferences. The model will be trained on real lensing images, incorporating observational constraints to refine mass distribution estimates and improve the efficiency of dark matter studies.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Difficulty level

Intermediate/Advanced

## Task ideas
 * Build various physics-informed neural network architectures that are endowed with known physics for real lensing datasets. 
 * Apply these models to study dark matter in strong lensing images in various contexts: classification, regression, anomaly detection, and more.
   
## Expected results
 *  A more capable architecture that can operate on a wider variety of lensing images, including lensing images created with real galaxy datasets.
 *  Insight into the lensing systems, and their sub-structures.

## Requirements
Python, PyTorch, experience with machine learning, knowledge of computer vision techniques, familiarity with autoencoders.
