## Description


One of the important aspects of searches for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) involves the identification and reconstruction of single particles, jets and event topologies of interest in collision events. The End-to-End Deep Learning (E2E) project in the CMS experiment focuses on the development  of these reconstruction and identification tasks with innovative deep learning approaches.   


This project will focus on the development of foundation models for end-to-end particle reconstruction with the goal of performing generative, classification and regression tasks.  
## Duration


Total project length: 175/350 hours.


## Difficulty level
Advanced


## Task ideas
 * Develop a pre-training strategy for learning robust representations of high-energy physics detector data.
*  Fine-tune the foundation model for multiple tasks such as classification, generative, super-resolution, and regression.
* Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on different HEP datasets and benchmark against individual methods for classification, regression etc.




## Expected results
 * Trained foundation model and benchmarks 
## Requirements
C++, Python, PyTorch and some previous experience in Machine Learning.
