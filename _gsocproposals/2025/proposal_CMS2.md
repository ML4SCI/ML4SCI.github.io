## Description

One of the important aspects of searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involves the identification and reconstruction of single particles, jets and event topologies of interest in collision events. In order to correctly reconstruct particles of interest, high resolution is required.

This project will focus on developing machine learning models to map processed, lower resolution data from particle from simulated particle collisions back to a higher resolution representation.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas
 * Develop a machine-learning super-resolution model to upsample particle collision data
 * Analyze performance on ground-truth simulated higher resolution data
 
## Expected results
 *  Trained models and benchmarks on simulated data

## Test

## Requirements
Python, C++, and some previous experience in Machine Learning.
