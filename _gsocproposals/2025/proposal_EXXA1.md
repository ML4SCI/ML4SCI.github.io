#### Description

The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is crucial for understanding their compositions, weather patterns, and potential habitability. This project aims to develop machine learning models to analyze spectral data from exoplanets, identifying chemical signatures and atmospheric properties. The project will leverage data from telescopes and space missions, along with simulations of exoplanetary atmospheres under various conditions, to train and validate the models.

#### Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

#### Task Ideas

  - Develop simulations of exoplanetary atmospheres with diverse chemical compositions and physical conditions.
  - Train machine learning models on simulated spectral data to recognize atmospheric characteristics.
  - Apply the models to real observational data from missions like Hubble, JWST, and future telescopes to characterize exoplanet atmospheres.
  - Explore the use of deep learning techniques for enhancing the models' ability to identify subtle spectral signatures.

#### Expected Results

  - A set of machine learning models capable of accurately characterizing exoplanet atmospheres.
  - Analysis of the models' performance on observational data, demonstrating their applicability to current and future exoplanet studies.
