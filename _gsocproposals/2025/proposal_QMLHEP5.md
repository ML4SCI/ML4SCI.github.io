## Description
The ambitious HL-LHC program will require enormous computing resources in the next two decades. New technologies are being sought after to replace the present computing infrastructure. A burning question is whether quantum computer can solve the ever growing demand of computing resources in High Energy Physics (HEP) in general and physics at LHC in particular.

Discovery of new physics requires the identification of rare signals against immense backgrounds. Development of machine learning methods will greatly enhance our ability to achieve this objective. With this project we seek to implement Quantum Machine Learning methods for LHC HEP analysis based on the Pennylane framework. This will enhance the ability of the HEP community to use Quantum Machine Learning methods.


## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours.

## Task ideas
  * Implement a quantum transformer architecture (QVIT, QTF).
  * Benchmark the trained model on selected tasks by e.g. employing a hybrid transformer (vision and sequence)
 
## Expected results
  * Trained quantum transformer model.
  * Benchmark of the performance on a HEP dataset compared against a classical reference model
