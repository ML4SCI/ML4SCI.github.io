## Description

One of the most important physical quantities in particle physics is the cross section, or a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. In this project we will explore googleâ€™s novel TITANS architecture to map from amplitudes to squared amplitudes using sequence to sequence representations.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Develop  symbolic regression models based on the novel Titans model architectures 
  * Benchmark these models on synthetic and high-energy physics datasets

   
## Requirements 
Significant experience with developing foundational models in Python (preferably using pytorch).

## Difficulty Level 
Advanced
