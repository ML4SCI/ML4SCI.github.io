## Description
One of the important aspects of searches for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) involves the identification and reconstruction of single particles, jets and event topologies of interest in collision events. The End-to-End Deep Learning (E2E) project in the CMS experiment focuses on the development  of these reconstruction and identification tasks with innovative deep learning approaches.   


A minimal representation of particle collision data is as an image representation of particle hits in different layers of the detector. This project will explore development of vision transformers incorporating the latest knowledge in the field of computer vision to classify particle collision images by the type of heavy particles generated in the collision and reconstruct the mass of those particles.
