## Description
The ambitious HL-LHC program will require enormous computing resources in the next two decades. New technologies are being sought to replace the present computing infrastructure. A burning question is whether quantum computers can solve the ever-growing demand for computing resources in High-Energy Physics (HEP) in general and physics at LHC in particular. Discovery of new physics requires the identification of rare signals against immense backgrounds. The development of machine learning methods will greatly enhance our ability to achieve this objective. With this project we seek to implement Quantum Machine Learning methods for LHC HEP analysis based on the Pennylane framework. This will enhance the ability of the HEP community to use Quantum Machine Learning methods.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas
  * Implement a Quantum Graph Neural Network (QGNN) method based on a suitable framework e.g. Pennylane. 
  * Apply the quantum machine learning method to a benchmark high-energy physics analysis and benchmark the quantum machine learning performance compared to classical machine learning methods

## Expected results
  * Trained Quantum Graph Neural Network with e.g. Pennylane framework.
  * Apply the Quantum Machine Learning method to LHC physics analysis and compare to classical machine learning methods.
