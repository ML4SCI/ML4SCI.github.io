## Description
In the search for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) it is necessary to simulate billions of high-energy collision events at high fidelity. One approach is to use accurate generative modeling to sample from latent space distribution. This project focuses on diffusion models as means of learning the latent structure to produce accurate multidimensional distribution of point cloud data of hits produced by particle interactions with the detectors. 

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Difficulty Level
  * Intermediate/Advanced

## Task ideas
  * Develop diffusion models for learning the latent space structure
  * Benchmarking on benchmark datasets and comparison to other generative models (VAEs/GANs/etc.) 
 
## Expected results
  * Functional diffusion model
  * Benchmarks on selected datasets
