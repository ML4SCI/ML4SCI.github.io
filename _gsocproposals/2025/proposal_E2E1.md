## Description

One of the important aspects of searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involves the identification and reconstruction of single particles, jets and event topologies of interest in collision events. The End-to-End Deep Learning (E2E) project in the CMS experiment focuses on the development of these reconstruction and identification tasks with innovative deep learning approaches.

One of the main objectives of the CMS experiments research and development towards high-luminosity LHC is to incorporate cutting-edge machine learning algorithms for particle reconstruction and identification into the CMS software framework (CMSSW) data processing pipeline. This project will focus on the integration of E2E framework with the CMSSW inference engine for use in reconstruction algorithms in offline and high-level trigger systems of the CMS experiment.


## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas
* Develop a deep learning model capable of uncovering the symmetries present in the dataset and the associated conserved quantities (paper).
* Utilize this symmetry to build a physics-aware neural network.



## Expected results
* Discover symmetries and conserved quantities present in the CMS dataset.
* Benchmark the models with other previous works in terms of data efficiency and invariance with respect to symmetry operations.


## Difficulty level
Advanced

## Requirements
* Proficiency in C++, Python
* Experience with PyTorch and TensorFlow
* Previous experience in Deep Learning
