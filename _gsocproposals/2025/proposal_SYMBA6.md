## Description


One of the most important physical quantities in particle physics is the cross section, or a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude (matrix M). 


## Duration


Total project length: 175/350 hours.


## Task ideas and expected results
  * Explore physics-informed ideas for improving data representations, physics-aware models, and physics simulations for squared amplitude calculation
  * Apply symbolic machine learning techniques to predict the squared amplitudes and cross section for high-energy physics 
   
## Requirements 
  * Python, C++ and some experience in Machine Learning sequence models.
  * Knowledge of physics and linear algebra is desired
