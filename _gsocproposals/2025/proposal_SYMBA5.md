## Description

Symbolic regression can be used to rapidly provide solutions to problems in science which may have large computational complexity or may even be intractable. It can be used to discover a symbolic expression describing data such as a physical law. Current directions in symbolic regression focus either on evolutionary/genetic programming approaches or alternatively transformer based solutions. This project will explore a combination of these ideas towards a new tool for symbolic regression that can be used to solve many problems in science.
As a concrete testbed for these new algorithms, the project will focus on predicting physical quantities, such as cross sections in high-energy physics, e.g a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. 

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Extend previous work on genetic algorithms and transformers from previous year's work
  * Benchmark these models on synthetic and  high-energy physics datasets
   
## Requirements 
Significant experience with Transformer machine learning models in Python (preferably using pytorch).

## Difficulty Level 
Advanced
