## Description

Symbolic regression can be used to rapidly provide solutions to problems in science which may have large computational complexity or may even be intractable. It can be used to discover a symbolic expression describing data such as a physical law. Previous work has explored combinations of Transformer models combined with genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning. Future work on this project might extend those approaches but could also include explorations of alternative approaches such as incorporation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Layers or novel LLM-based approaches. As a concrete testbed for these new algorithms, the project will focus on predicting physical quantities, such as cross sections in high-energy physics, e.g a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Develop  symbolic regression models based on next-gen transformer architectures
  * Develop a hybrid method based on elements of both approaches
  * Benchmark these models on synthetic and  high-energy physics datasets
   
## Requirements 
Significant experience with Transformer machine learning models in Python (preferably using pytorch).

## Difficulty Level 
Intermediate
