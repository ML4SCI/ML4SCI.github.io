## Description

The Rubin Observatory will provide an unprecedented volume of astronomical data, accessible via a dedicated open-source software suite consisting of data reduction pipelines and tools for interacting with calibrated images and catalogs. In order to prepare for the application of DeepLense methods on upcoming LSST data, this project focuses on developing a complementary pipeline that integrates LSSTâ€™s data access tools with DeepLense workflows. This pipeline will enable efficient data retrieval, preprocessing, and adaptation for various DeepLense applications such as lens finding, super-resolution, and classification.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Difficulty level

Intermediate/Advanced

## Task ideas
 * Explore the existing LSST data access tools and design the workflow to provide the data for the DeepLense tasks.
 * Test the workflow on the mock surveys provided by The Rubin Observatory.

## Expected results
 *  A functional pipeline capable of interfacing LSST data with DeepLense applications.

## Requirements
Python, familiarity with astronomical data processing, and understanding of data access APIs and pipelines.
