## Description


One of the important aspects of searches for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) involves the identification and reconstruction of single particles, jets and event topologies of interest in collision events. The End-to-End Deep Learning (E2E) project in the CMS experiment focuses on the development  of these reconstruction and identification tasks with innovative deep learning approaches.   


One potential approach for particle reconstruction is to take minimally processed detector hit information from jets of decayed particles and rebuild the tracks that the originating particles followed and derive further quantities from those tracks. This project will focus on using machine learning models to achieve this reconstruction.
