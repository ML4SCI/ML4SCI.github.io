## Description
[DeepFalcon](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2020_138.pdf) is a generative ultra-fast non-parametric detector simulation package. The goal of this project is to extend DeepFalcon to extend the current graph VAE to improve simulation of calorimeter and tracker hits from particle interaction with the detectors

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Extend and scale Graph VAEs to the multi-layer detectors.
	 * Test various graph connectivities, pooling etc. to optimize the performance.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.
