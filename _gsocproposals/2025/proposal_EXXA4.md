#### Description

The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is crucial for understanding their compositions, weather patterns, and potential habitability. This project aims to develop machine learning models to analyze spectral data from exoplanets, identifying chemical abundances, cloud/haze structure and different atmospheric processes . The project will leverage data from telescopes and space missions, along with simulations of exoplanetary atmospheres under various conditions, to train and validate the models.

#### Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

#### Task Ideas

  * Perform  simulations of exoplanetary atmospheres with diverse atmospheric conditions: non-isothermal atmospheres; chemical equilibrium/disequilibrium; dawn/dusk asymmetry; distinct weather patterns; cloud/haze coverage etc.
  * Train machine learning models on simulated spectral data to recognize different atmospheric conditions and physical processes using  transmission and/or emission spectroscopy.
  * Develop a ML strategy for searching of potential biosignatures in spectroscopic observations.
  * Apply the trained models to real observational data from missions like Hubble, JWST, and future telescopes to characterize exoplanet atmospheres.
  * Explore the use of deep learning techniques for enhancing the models’ ability to identify subtle spectral signatures associated with different atmospheric processes.


#### Expected Results

  * A set of machine learning models capable of accurately characterizing exoplanet atmospheres.
  * Analysis of the models’ performance on observational data, demonstrating their applicability to current and future exoplanet studies.
