## Description
In many engineering and physics domains, the shape or geometry of an object directly influences its performance with regard to some metric. Simple examples include the shape of an airplane wing affecting its lift-to-drag ratio, or the geometry/structure of a bridge influencing the maximum load weight which can safely traverse it. “Shape optimization” refers to the task of identifying the ideal shape/geometry of such an object which can maximize or minimize a metric of interest with respect to that object. This project looks to leverage Physics Influenced Neural Networks (PINN) and Coordinate Projection Networks (also called shape networks in the literature) to develop machine learning architectures which can quickly and efficiently perform this task.

## Duration
Total project length: 175 hours.

## Task ideas
  * Identify relevant use-case scenario and develop a PINN to accurately model underlying physics.
  * Perform model optimization of both PINN and coordinate projection network.

## Expected results:
  * PINN model with demonstrated ability to perform shape optimization.

## Difficulty level
Advanced

## Requirements
  * Essential: Experience in Python, PyTorch (or related ML framework), and machine learning are required. 
  * Preferred: Familiarity with basic physics concepts (classical mechanics, electromagnetics, etc.) at an undergraduate level. 
  * Will help you stand out: Experience performing physics simulations using standard simulation software (COMSOL, ANSYS, etc.) or an equivalent open source framework, and familiarity with associated concepts (numerical methods techniques, how to handle boundary conditions, etc.).
