## Description
A key challenge in data quality monitoring (DQM) in high-energy physics (HEP) is the need for online monitoring and control of the experiment with the data that is sensitive to underlying conditions and the constantly evolving state of the detector components. Developing and implementing software solutions for this subfield generally requires specialized knowledge of both physics and niche software tools. In order to assist and accelerate research in HEP DQM, this project aims to develop a specizlied AI agent following the HEPTAPOD framework.

## Duration
Total project length: 175 hours.

## Task ideas
 * Develop and test an AI physics agent following the HEPTAPOD framework

## Expected results
 * Complete an AI agent to accelerate and assist in HEP DQM development.
 * Document results formally or informally to support ongoing research.

## Requirements
C++, Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, previous experience in Deep Learning.

## Project difficulty level
Advanced
