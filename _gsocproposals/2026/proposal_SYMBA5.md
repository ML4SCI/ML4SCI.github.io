title: LM-JEPA for Squared Amplitude Calculation
layout: gsoc_proposal
project: SYMBA
year: 2026
organization:

---

## Description
One of the most important physical quantities in particle physics is the cross section, or a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. This project will explore language model joint embedding predictive architectures for calculation of squared amplitudes.

## Duration
Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Develop  symbolic models to predict squared amplitudes based on reduced size versions of LLM-JEPA model architectures.
  * Quantify the performance of LM-JEPA techniques.
  * Document results formally or informally to support ongoing research.
   
## Requirements 
Significant experience with developing models in Python (preferably using pytorch). Experience with Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures and/or LLM development is preferred.

## Difficulty Level 
Advanced
