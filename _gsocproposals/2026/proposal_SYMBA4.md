## Description
One of the most important physical quantities in particle physics is the cross section, or a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. In this project we will explore Google’s recent Titans architecture combined with MIRAS to map from amplitudes to squared amplitudes using sequence to sequence representations.

## Duration
Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Develop  symbolic models to predict squared amplitudes based on the Titans model architecture combined with MIRAS.
  * Quantify the performance of various Titans model frameworks using ablation studies.
  * Document results formally or informally to support ongoing research.

## Requirements 
Significant experience with developing models from literature in Python (preferably using pytorch).

## Difficulty Level 
Advanced
