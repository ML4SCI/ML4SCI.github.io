## Description
One of the most important physical quantities in particle physics is the cross section, or a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. Previous work has explored the use of language translation techniques to predict text-based squared amplitudes from text-based representations of Feynman diagrams or their amplitudes. This project aims to improve numerical accuracy or reduce computational cost by moving from purely language-translation-based solutions to solutions based on physically-motivated machine learning models. This project is closely related to the project “Physics-Informed Encoding and Decoding for Squared Amplitude Calculation”.

## Duration
Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Develop physics-informed machine learning models for Feynman diagrams, amplitudes, and/or squared amplitudes.
  * Carry out ablation studies to quantify improvement from introducing physics-informed techniques.
  * Document results formally or informally to support ongoing research.
   
## Requirements 
Significant experience with machine learning models in Python (preferably using pytorch). Previous work in physics informed machine learning and/or graph models is preferred.

## Difficulty Level 
Advanced
