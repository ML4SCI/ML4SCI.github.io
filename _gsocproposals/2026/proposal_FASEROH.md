## Description

State-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, a class of neural sequence models, have led to significant advances in neural machine translation (NMT) (see, for example, [NMT-Felix Stahlberg](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02047.pdf)). Recently, these models have been successfully applied to [symbolic mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412) by conceptualizing the latter as translation from one sequence of symbols to another. It is easy to imagine numerous tasks that can be construed as translation problems. 

In the proposed GSoC project, the goal is to create a tool that automatically provides an accurate symbolic representation of a histogram by framing the problem as a translation task from a histogram to a symbolic function. We call this project **Fast Accurate Symbolic Empirical Representation Of Histograms (FASEROH)**.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas
  * The goal of the project is to use available seq2seq models to create the mapping between an histogram and a symbolic function. See more details [here](https://ml4sci.org/assets/faseroh.pdf).


## Expected results
  * Since this project will be a proof of principle, the seq2seq task will be limited to 1-dimensional histograms defined on the unit interval.
   
## Requirements 
Python, previous experience in Machine Learning.
