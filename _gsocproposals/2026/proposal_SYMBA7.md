## Description
Symbolic regression can be used to rapidly provide solutions to problems in science which may have large computational complexity or may even be intractable. It can be used to discover a symbolic expression describing data such as a physical law. Previous work has explored combinations of Transformer models and genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning. This project will explore language model joint embedding predictive architectures for symbolic regression.

## Duration
Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Develop  symbolic regression models based on reduced size versions of LLM-JEPA model architectures.
  * Benchmark these models on synthetic symbolic regression datasets.
  * Document results formally or informally to support ongoing research.
   
## Requirements 
Significant experience with developing models in Python (preferably using pytorch). Experience with Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures and/or LLM development is preferred.
