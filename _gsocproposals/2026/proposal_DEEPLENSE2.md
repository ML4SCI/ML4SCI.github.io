## Description

Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for studying dark matter and the large-scale structure of the universe. Strong gravitational lensing images encode subtle signatures of dark matter substructure that can distinguish between competing theoretical models (Cold Dark Matter, Axion or Fuzzy Dark Matter, no substructure). While classical deep learning has shown promise in this classification task, the high dimensional feature spaces and complex correlations in lensing images may benefit from quantum computational approaches.
This project proposes the development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models for dark matter substructure classification. Quantum neural networks leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to explore exponentially large Hilbert spaces, potentially capturing correlations that classical networks miss. Hybrid quantum classical architectures, where quantum circuits serve as trainable feature extractors within classical pipelines, offer a practical near term approach compatible with current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) devices.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Difficulty level

## Task ideas
 * Implement hybrid quantum-classical architectures (variational quantum circuits, quantum kernels) for dark matter substructure classification from strong lensing images.
 * Benchmark quantum models against classical baselines and evaluate noise robustness under realistic NISQ conditions.

## Expected results

 * Benchmark of quantum vs. classical performance with analysis of near-term hardware feasibility.

## Requirements
 * Strong background in Machine Learning & Deep Learning.
 * Knowledge of Quantum Computing (VQAs, Quantum Optimization).
 * Proficiency in Python & Pennylane or Qiskit.
 * Ability to work independently on research projects.
