## Description

This project focuses on the task of lens finding in the currently available wide-field surveys (e.g., HSC-SSP). The expected number of strong lenses in the large surveys is significantly overpowered by the number of non-lensed objects, which leads to the high number of false positives in typical lens searches. 

The goal of the project is to develop lens finding algorithms, apply them to the observational data, and  assess the limitations of the algorithms (for example, analyse the properties of the identified lens population and examine the typical contaminants).

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Difficulty level
Intermediate/Advanced

## Task ideas
 * Start with architectures previously explored within the DeepLense project and optimise them for the lens finding task
 * Perform the lens search in the real observational data and analyse the properties of the detected lens candidates
 * Evaluate model performance on different surveys

## Expected results
 *  Increase the number of known strong lenses.
 *  Insight into properties of the identified lens candidates.
   
## Requirements
Python, PyTorch, experience with machine learning, familiarity with astrophysics datasets.
