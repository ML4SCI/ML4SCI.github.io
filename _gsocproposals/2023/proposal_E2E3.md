## Description

One of the important aspects of searches for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) involves the identification and reconstruction of single particles, jets and event topologies of interest in collision events. The End-to-End Deep Learning (E2E) project in the CMS experiment focuses on the development  of these reconstruction and identification tasks with innovative deep learning approaches.   

This project will focus on the development of end-to-end deep learning regression for estimating particle properties and [CMSSW](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw) inference engine for use in reconstruction algorithms in offline and high-level trigger systems of the [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) experiment.


## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas
 * Development of end-to-end deep learning regression for particle property measurements
 * Test and integration into CMSSW

## Expected results
 * Trained end-to-end deep learning regression model for estimating the properties of a simulated top quark pair event 
 * Extension of currently integrated E2E CMSSW prototype to include the regression model inference

## Requirements
 * Skills: C++, Python, PyTorch and some previous experience in Machine Learning.
