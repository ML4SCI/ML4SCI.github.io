## Description

One of the important aspects of searches for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) involves the identification and reconstruction of single particles, jets and event topologies of interest in collision events. The End-to-End Deep Learning (E2E) project in the CMS experiment focuses on the development  of these reconstruction and identification tasks with innovative deep learning approaches.   

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas
 * Develop suitable equivariant neural network models and use them to analyze the collision data
 * Benchmark the equivariant neural network with vision transformers and convolution-based models
 * Extend the idea of Equivariant Neural Networks to exploit symmetries to finding and understanding symmetries and asymmetries in the data

## Expected results
 * Achieve competitive results using equivariant neural networks
 * Benchmark the models with other previous works in terms of speed, performance and data efficiency.


## Requirements
C++, Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow and some previous experience in Machine Learning.

## Test
Please use [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWTSASnVICm_4Zof7wr6_LkS24P_Z8TR1px_tctemQI/edit) to access the test for this project.
**The test is due by April 3rd, however please keep in mind that it takes about 1 week to craft a good proposal and proposals need to be submitted via GSoC portal by April 4**
