## Description

Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter to better understand its underlying nature. Deep learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate [WIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles) particle dark matter from other well motivated models, including vortex substructure of dark matter condensates and superfluids.

This project will focus on further development of the simulations used in the DeepLense pipeline which utilize the package [lenstronomy](https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The focus of this project will be to help improve and facilitate the creation of data for applications with various ML approaches in this project. 

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours.

## Task ideas
 * Help to streamline the simulation of strong lensing data sets. 
 * Create simulated strong lensing data sets that are designed to meet the various needs of other ML projects. 
 * Modify simulations to include new dark matter physics and as well as increase simulation fidelity by accounting for other observational systematics. 

## Expected results
 *  Update and streamline code used by project and generate several simulated lensing data sets.

## Requirements
Python and some previous experience with physics or astronomy. 

## Test
Test will become live after GSoC Orgs are announced
