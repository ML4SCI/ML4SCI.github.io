## Description
[DeepFalcon](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2020_138.pdf) is a generative ultra-fast non-parametric detector simulation package. The goal of this project is to extend DeepFalcon to include diffusion models to improve simulation of calorimeter and tracker hits from particle interaction with the detectors

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Implementation of diffusion networks into the falcon training and inference.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Test
Please use this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwRaHc0IYIcFOokMcW-mYJv2i24iP1mm08ALTSyQ4EI/edit?usp=sharing) to access the test for this project.


## Requirements
Strong machine learning skills, good knowledge of C++ and Python. Interest in Machine Learning algorithms and applications.
