## Description
Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter to better understand its underlying nature. Deep learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate [WIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles) particle dark matter from other well motivated models, including vortex substructure of dark matter condensates and superfluids.

This project will focus on further development of the simulations used in the DeepLense pipeline which utilize the package __lenstronomy__. This will include working to increase the fidelity of the simulations and also working to expand the range of dark matter models considered for simulation. The project will also include helping to improve and facilitate the creation of data for applications with various ML approaches in this project.

## Duration
Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Difficulty level
Intermediate/Advanced

## Task ideas
* Help to streamline the simulation of strong lensing data sets.
* Create simulated strong lensing data sets that are designed to meet the various needs of other ML projects.
* Modify simulations to include new dark matter physics and as well as increase simulation fidelity by accounting for other observational systematics.

## Expected results
Update and streamline code used by project and generate several simulated lensing data sets.

## Requirements
Python and some previous experience with physics or astronomy.
