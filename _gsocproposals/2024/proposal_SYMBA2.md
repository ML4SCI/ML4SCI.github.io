## Description

One of the most important physical quantities in particle physics is the cross section, or a probability that a particular process takes place in the interaction of elementary particles. Its measure provides a testable link between theory and experiment. It is obtained theoretically mainly by calculating the squared amplitude. In this project we will explore state-space models (SSMs) to map from amplitudes to squared amplitudes using sequence to sequence representations.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Develop and deploy state-space models (SSM) for symbolic solutions of squared amplitude calculations
  * Benchmark the SSM models with other transformer-based solutions
  * Integrated with the SymbaHEP pipeline
   
## Requirements 
Significant experience with machine learning models in Python (preferably using pytorch).

## Difficulty Level 
Advanced
