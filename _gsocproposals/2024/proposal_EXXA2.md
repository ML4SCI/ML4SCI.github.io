title:  Characterization of Transiting Exoplanets from Transmission Spectroscopy
layout: gsoc_proposal

## Description

Transmission spectroscopy provides a powerful tool to decode the chemical composition of the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. This project will bring in modern machine learning (ML) methods to advance the theoretical framework for exoplanet parameter retrievals and test it using synthetic spectroscopic data. A tangible output of this work will be a publicly available code that takes a spectrum of a transiting planet and returns a reliable determination, with corresponding uncertainties, of its atmospheric chemical composition.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours

## Task ideas
 * Training a regression ML model using publicly available spectroscopic database
 * Uncertainty quantification on the retrieved parameters

## Expected results
 * publicly available code to be used for spectral analysis of exoplanet observations from the JWST and Ariel missions
 * Benchmarking the results against existing Bayesian retrieval models (TauREx, Transit)

## Requirements
  * Python, previous experience in machine learning
  * Basic knowledge of astronomy and observations is useful but not required
