## Description
The concept of Optimal Transport (OT) can be very useful in quantifying a distance metric between probability distributions. This project will focus on applying optimal transport methods to classification, anomaly detection and generative modeling tasks in particle physics.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas and expected results
Application of optimal transport techniques using deep learning for classification, anomaly detection and graph generative models in high energy physics.

## Test
Please use this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bwRaHc0IYIcFOokMcW-mYJv2i24iP1mm08ALTSyQ4EI/edit?usp=sharing) to access the test for this project.

## Requirements
Strong machine learning skills, good knowledge of C++ and Python. Interest in Machine Learning algorithms and applications.
