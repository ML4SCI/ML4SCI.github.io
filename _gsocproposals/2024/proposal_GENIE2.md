## Description
In the search for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) it is necessary to accurately learn the representation of events that may be described in different ways (point clouds, graphs, grids). Different detector systems can lead to different optimal representations and no single approach is ideal for all detector systems. Conventional representations are usually discrete (point clouds, grids etc.). This project focuses on an alternative approach of parametrizing the representation in terms of a continuous function and approximating it with a neural network. 


## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.

## Task ideas
  * Develop implicit neural representation model for particle physics data
  * Benchmarking on benchmark datasets 
 
## Expected results
  * Functional INR model
  * Benchmark results  on selected datasets
