## Description
In the search for new physics at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) a possible approach is to employ anomaly detection techniques to spot events that deviate from the standard model in an unsupervised manner. There have been many such studies using e.g. convolutional autoencoders. In previous GSoC projects, the usage of graph based models have been very successful in generative tasks. In this project we therefore want to employ a graph based architecture to perform anomaly detection on particle collision data.

The intended model is supposed to perform anomaly detection on a graph-level, corresponding literature can be found in the ‘Links’ section.

## Duration

Total project length: 175/350 hours.
